# 📊 Salary Data Cleaning and Analysis

## 🚀 Project Summary
In real-world scenarios, datasets are rarely clean or ready for direct analysis.  
This project focuses on transforming **raw, uncleaned salary data** into a structured and meaningful dataset using **Python-based data analysis techniques**.

The repository demonstrates **industry-standard data preprocessing**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and **basic visualization techniques**, making it ideal for students and beginners entering the field of **Data Analytics and Data Science**.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Raw salary datasets often contain:
- Missing or null values
- Incorrect data types
- Duplicate entries
- Inconsistent formatting
- Outliers affecting analysis accuracy

The challenge is to clean and preprocess this data effectively so that accurate insights can be derived.
